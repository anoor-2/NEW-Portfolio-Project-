        <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
        <p>My name is Averi Noor. As of right now, I'm a sophomore at Franklin Central Highschool. I'm set to graduate in 2028 and my favorite colors are green and blue. I love everything, but my favorites are reading, baking, astronomy, and marine biology. Fun fact, I also play the violin and the electric guitar.
        When I was 6 and 7 years old, I participated in regional and state chess tournaments and at one point, won top 15 in the Washington State Elementary Chess Tournament. In 8th grade I participated in a program known as BPA, which stands for Business Professionals of America.
        Now, in the summer of my freshman year, I particapted in the Nextech Catapult Program.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Me and Computer Science</h1>
        <p>My first interaction with any sort of computer science was when I was 7. I had found this book about scatch <!-- (a site made for creating programs through scratch's own block-based programming language) -->  
            and instantly got interemsted. At the time however, I didn't know what coding was. I just liked the book because it was colorful and had pictures in it. Later on, my mom, who majored in computer science, 
            sat down and showed me how to create projects through scratch, and after that, I had fallen in love with coding. Or at least, what I knew of it.
            Fast forward about 6 years and my freshman year comes around. I hadn't been planning on taking any strange or difficutlt elective, but my parents insisted on me taking principles of computing.
            At the time, I was so against the idea because I was absolutely fixed on the idea that I would do terrible in that class.<br> <br>But of course, my parents won the argument. <br> <br>
            But it was only because they made me take the class in the first place that my teacher, Mr. Lemke, had introduced me to the Nextech Catapult Internship, which is where I sat down and created this portfolio. </p>
